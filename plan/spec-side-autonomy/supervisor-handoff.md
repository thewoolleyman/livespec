# Supervisor Handoff - spec-side-autonomy

## Resume state — written 2026-08-03 at session wrap-up

READ THIS FIRST. It is the live state of the thread and it EXPIRES: re-measure
everything below before acting on it. The detailed supervisor record is at
`/data/projects/livespec/tmp/overseer/spec-side-autonomy/.supervisor-state`
(gitignored, same host, read by the cold-open boot block); the briefs that drove
this work are `brief-01` through `brief-10` in that same directory.

### Increment 1 — COMPLETE, MERGED, AND RELEASED

Ratified as `SPECIFICATION/history/v190`, then built factory-side as four
slices, all merged:

| slice | work-item | PR |
|---|---|---|
| A — `spec_governance` registry, resolvers, control CLI, journal | `livespec-rvduou` | 1939 |
| B — `ratification_review` auto-spawn | `livespec-mrxwbr` | 1942 |
| C — `doctor_dispositions` | `livespec-d2f5pf` | 1949 |
| D — intent/topic threading, non-interactive modes | `livespec-p4pcxv` | 1944 |

Released in **v0.24.1**, verified by ancestry (slice C's merge sha is an
ancestor of the tag). Six config keys ship, ALL at safe defaults that arm
nothing. Exercised live end-to-end: report, arm, refuse-invalid, clear, with
JSONC comments preserved (46 before and after three edits).

`spec_pr_merge` was REJECTED from Increment 1 after three consecutive BLOCKERS
reviews and relocated to `livespec-bhammf` (blocked, needs-human) carrying both
blocker texts verbatim and the `--proposal-stem` vs `--base-ref` transport fix.

### Increment 2 — IN FLIGHT, correctly gated

Proposal `spec-governance-revise-decision-mode` is filed as PR **1948**
(proposal-only, explicitly non-ratifying). The independent Fable review returned
**BLOCKERS** — three findings: the revise digest framing, a missing durable
revision-record audit clause in candidate contracts.md, and an unqualified
human-gated overview retained in candidate spec.md. A blocker is NEVER
self-waived; the worker is resolving them and must obtain a NO-BLOCKERS verdict
before any revise. Worker worktree: `spec/ratify-spec-governance-increment-2`.
PR **1961** carries the worker's own handoff of this blocker.

### Increment 3 — BLOCKED ON AN EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY, not on this thread

The maintainer AUTHORIZED the drift amendment (consensus tier only, dedicated
`drift_acceptance_mode` key, never `delegated`, default `human`, opt-in) and
authorized automating the groom cut last behind the same tier with slice-size
ceilings and a regroom cap. The MECHANISM does not exist: the cross-vendor
unanimous consensus panel is built by `livespec-overseer`'s `plan/foreman`
thread in its Phase C. Do not attempt Increment 3 until that panel ships. Do NOT
edit the drift-doctrine sentence at `SPECIFICATION/spec.md` before then.

### Open ledger items under epic `livespec-jvdvx4`

- `livespec-bhammf` — blocked, needs-human. The relocated `spec_pr_merge`
  redesign. Not Increment 1 work; do not treat it as unfinished business.
- `livespec-jvdvx4.1` — was `active` at wrap-up. A REAL conformance defect I
  filed and independently verified: the shipped `_canonical_ratification_digest`
  omits `LP(P)`, uses decimal-colon framing instead of uint64 big-endian, and
  never sorts `resulting_files[]` — all three contrary to the v190 contract at
  `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` §"Ratification-review evidence". It shipped green
  because its tests round-trip the implementation against itself and never
  assert the byte framing. Consequence: without `LP(P)` the digest does not bind
  the reviewed PROPOSAL at all, so a NO-BLOCKERS review of one proposal can be
  replayed against another that yields the same resulting files.

### Fleet deployment — PARTIAL, verify before declaring done

A pin that merely moved is not a pin that carries this work. Measured at
wrap-up:

    livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro  v0.24.1   carries Increment 1
    livespec-overseer                  v0.24.1   carries Increment 1
    livespec-dev-tooling               v0.24.1   carries Increment 1
    livespec-driver-claude             v0.22.0   LAGS
    livespec-driver-codex              v0.23.0   LAGS

The fan-out is automatic (`release-dispatch.yml` → `bump-pin-from-dispatch.yml`,
guarded by `pin-freshness.yml`) and PRs were open for the laggards. Confirm each
sibling reaches a tag >= v0.24.1 before calling deployment complete. Increment 1
needs NO sibling CODE changes — the levers are entirely core-owned, so the pin
bump is the whole deployment.

### Standing hazards for whoever resumes

- **Concurrent sessions are ratifying into this same repo.** Master moved v190 →
  v192 during one session. A revise `resulting_files[]` entry REPLACES THE
  ENTIRE FILE, so a splice computed against a stale read silently reverts
  another session's change and git reports NO CONFLICT. Re-fetch and re-derive
  every entry from fresh bytes immediately before applying.
- **A codex worker drains its input queue only at turn end.** Instructions
  accumulate against a world-state that may not survive until they are read. One
  queued order would have corrupted v190 had it landed minutes later. VOID a
  stale queue; never append to it.
- **Keep every dispatchable work-item description under ~1500 characters**, with
  provenance in journal notes. A 7196-char item implemented its whole change and
  then died mid-publish, losing an hour.
- **Filed factory defect** `bd-ib-3ftj` in `livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro`:
  the dispatcher staleness gate cannot identify a codex plugin-cache root, so
  every codex-host dispatch silently skips its plugin-currency check.

### Next concrete action

Drive Increment 2 to NO-BLOCKERS and ratify it. Then verify the two lagging
Driver pins reach >= v0.24.1. Do not archive `plan/spec-side-autonomy/` — the
thread spans three increments and Increment 3 remains open on a named external
dependency.

## Shared Protocol

Read `.ai/supervisor-protocol.md` before driving. Validate this binder together
with that shared layer; neither layer is complete by itself.

Regeneration MUST preserve both Corrections sections byte-for-byte:

- `.ai/supervisor-protocol.md` `## Corrections` for role-level corrections.
- This binder's `## Corrections` for thread-specific corrections.

Preserve spelling, punctuation, code formatting, blank lines, and ordering
exactly; do not normalize Markdown or code spans. Live thread status is not in
this binder. Re-measure it from the ledger, the thread's planning records,
forge artifacts, and the supervisor marker.

Run this cold-open boot block after resolving `supervisor_marker` from the
Bindings table:

```sh
test -f ".ai/supervisor-protocol.md" \
  || { echo "HALT: missing shared supervisor protocol .ai/supervisor-protocol.md"; echo "REMEDY: regenerate the two-layer supervisor handoff before driving"; exit 1; }
printf '%s\n' "BOOT: read .ai/supervisor-protocol.md, this binder, and the supervisor marker if it exists"
[ -n "${supervisor_marker:-}" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: supervisor_marker is unset or empty"; echo "REMEDY: resolve it from this binder's bindings table before running this block — an unset marker makes the read below display NOTHING and still exit 0"; exit 1; }
if [ ! -f "$supervisor_marker" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' "NOTE: no supervisor marker at $supervisor_marker yet — nothing to read."
else
  marker_lines=$(wc -l < "$supervisor_marker")
  if [ "$marker_lines" -le 400 ]; then
    cat "$supervisor_marker"
  else
    sed -n '1,160p' "$supervisor_marker"
    printf '\n*** TRUNCATED: lines 161-%d of %d NOT SHOWN (%d hidden). A claim above may be RETRACTED in the hidden range. Read %s in full before acting on anything above. ***\n\n' \
      "$((marker_lines - 160))" "$marker_lines" "$((marker_lines - 320))" "$supervisor_marker"
    sed -n "$((marker_lines - 159)),${marker_lines}p" "$supervisor_marker"
  fi
fi
```

The read is whole-file up to 400 lines and head-and-tail beyond it. The
truncation notice is mandatory whenever anything is hidden: a constant cap
rots as an append-only marker grows, a head-only cut can separate a live claim
from its later retraction, and Corrections land at the end.

## Bindings

Resolve and report these startup bindings before driving. They contain no live
status, next action, or date-gated behavior.

| Binding | Value |
|---|---|
| `repo_primary` | `/data/projects/livespec` |
| `thread_dir` | `/data/projects/livespec/plan/spec-side-autonomy` |
| `topic` | `spec-side-autonomy` |
| `worker_session` | `spec-side-autonomy` |
| `supervisor_session` | `spec-side-autonomy-supervisor` |
| `WORKER_TARGET` | `'=spec-side-autonomy:'` |
| `SUPERVISOR_TARGET` | `'=spec-side-autonomy-supervisor:'` |
| `runtime_dir` | `/data/projects/livespec/tmp/overseer/spec-side-autonomy/` |
| `supervisor_marker` | `/data/projects/livespec/tmp/overseer/spec-side-autonomy/.supervisor-state` |
| `wait_channel` | `/data/projects/livespec/tmp/overseer/spec-side-autonomy/worker-status.log` |
| `ledger_anchor` | `livespec-jvdvx4` |

Placeholder classes declared by this binder:

- Concretely bound: `repo_primary`, `topic`, `worker_session`,
  `supervisor_session`, and `ledger_anchor`.
- Composed bindings resolved transitively to the fixed-point values shown in
  the table: `thread_dir`, `WORKER_TARGET`, `SUPERVISOR_TARGET`, `runtime_dir`,
  `supervisor_marker`, and `wait_channel`.
- Runtime slots intentionally left unsubstituted for the supervisor to fill at
  use time: `<condition-command>`, `<short-slug>`, and `<branch>`.
- Illustrative placeholders appear only in prose discussing a form, never in a
  fenced command. In the shared protocol, `<repo-primary>` and `<topic>`
  describe reusable path shapes, including `plan/<topic>/supervisor-handoff.md`.
  In this binder's Thread-specific Valves, `<id>` describes the shape of the
  orchestrator action `impl:<id>`. None of these are shell substitutions.

After resolving concrete and composed bindings to the values above, every
fenced shell command contains no generation-time placeholder. The three named
runtime slots are deliberate templates and are not generation errors.

## Generator provenance

This charter was produced by the generator recorded below. The prose digest is
the identity; the plugin, cache ref, and version are human-readable companions.
Run the check before driving so a refreshed cache cannot silently leave this
charter on an older generator. This invocation read the Claude plugin cache, so
the self-check uses that same runtime's cache root.

```sh
generator_plugin='livespec-overseer'
generator_ref='448032c6dcf1'
generator_version='0.16.2'
generator_prose_md5='eaebe06065b3efa0053d6ea5932d52c0'
cache_root="$HOME/.claude/plugins/cache/$generator_plugin/$generator_plugin"
generator_prose="$cache_root/$generator_ref/prose/supervise-plan.md"
if [ ! -d "$cache_root" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' "UNVERIFIED: no plugin cache at $cache_root, so this is not a host that generates charters and provenance cannot be checked here. Recorded generator: $generator_prose_md5"
elif [ ! -f "$generator_prose" ]; then
  echo "HALT: the cache at $cache_root no longer holds ref $generator_ref, so the generator that emitted this charter has been replaced"
  echo "REMEDY: regenerate this charter with supervise-plan, or re-point generator_ref at the installed ref and re-stamp generator_prose_md5 from it"
  exit 1
else
  installed=$(md5sum "$generator_prose")
  digest_rc=$?
  [ "$digest_rc" -eq 0 ] \
    || { echo "HALT: cannot digest the installed generator prose at $generator_prose"; echo "REMEDY: fix read access before trusting anything this charter says about its own currency"; exit 1; }
  installed_md5=${installed%% *}
  [ "$installed_md5" = "$generator_prose_md5" ] \
    || { echo "HALT: this charter was emitted by generator $generator_prose_md5 but the installed generator is $installed_md5"; echo "REMEDY: regenerate this charter before driving, or re-stamp generator_prose_md5 deliberately after reading what changed between the two"; exit 1; }
  printf '%s\n' "PASS: charter provenance matches the installed generator ($installed_md5)"
fi
```

A missing cache root means provenance cannot be checked on that host and is
reported as UNVERIFIED without making the committed charter unreadable. An
existing cache root that no longer contains the recorded ref means the
generator was replaced and is a HALT. These absence cases are intentionally
different. The recorded version is a companion, not the identity: this same
prose digest also shipped under version `0.15.0`, so a version match would
report a different generator where there is one and the same.

## Thread-specific Valves

- The ledger anchor is epic `livespec-jvdvx4` in the `livespec` tenant. The
  design record is `plan/spec-side-autonomy/research/brainstorm.md`; it is
  historical design evidence, not a status ledger. Read status from the ledger.
- **Lane A is CLOSED as of 2026-08-03. Do not re-ask its three values calls.**
  All three are resolved and recorded in `plan/spec-side-autonomy/handoff.md`
  §"Lane A — CLOSED" and `research/brainstorm.md` §"Values calls — ALL THREE
  RESOLVED 2026-08-03". Re-opening them requires a fresh maintainer decision,
  not a re-ask. The lane-independence rule it used to carry still holds for any
  FUTURE maintainer-owned call: such a call gates only the increment that needs
  it, never the whole thread, so stand down on that action alone and keep
  driving everything else.
- The resolved decisions bind later increments and are not recommendations:
  drift acceptance is amendable to the consensus tier ONLY, through a DEDICATED
  `spec_governance.drift_acceptance_mode` key (`human | consensus`, default
  `human`, opt-in), never through `revise_decision_mode` and never to
  `delegated`; the groom cut may be automated last, consensus-gated, with
  slice-size ceilings and a regroom cap as required rails; the consensus-tier
  definition lives in livespec core and is implemented by
  `livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro` and `livespec-overseer`.
- **Class (c) doctrine floors are the checks this thread must not weaken.**
  Drift acceptance, the groom cut, and the truly-unresolvable set may not be
  touched by any config key without a ratified spec amendment, and any such
  amendment is Increment 3. Lane A unblocked those amendments in principle, but
  Increment 3 stays blocked in practice until the consensus panel exists, and
  the `drift_acceptance_mode` key must not ship armed-able before it does. The
  shared protocol's "never
  REMOVE, WEAKEN, or SKIP an existing check" applies here to doctrine sentences,
  not only to executable checks — a proposal that relaxes one of these is a
  reversal of a safety guarantee and reaches the maintainer.
- The `drive` contract's refusal of spec-side action-ids in
  `livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro` is deliberately preserved. The foreman is
  the spec-side executor. Do not propose changing that refusal.
- Every proposed change this thread files is ratified only after the independent
  read-only adversarial review returns NO BLOCKERS, per `AGENTS.md`
  §"Independent Fable review before every ratification" and
  `.ai/spec-proposal-review.md`. A blocker routes to the maintainer with a
  recommended fix and is never self-waived — including when this thread is the
  author of the proposal under review.
- File one topic file per independently-acceptable piece. A revise decision is
  per proposed-change FILE, so a bundle that must be dispositioned selectively
  has to be split before it is filed.
- Ready, factory-safe implementation slices are built factory-side — the `drive`
  operation with action `impl:<id>`, or the Dispatcher drain — never inline in
  a planning session. File them as children of `livespec-jvdvx4`.
- Cross-repo pieces land as ONE epic with per-repo child work-items and
  cross-repo links, never as "follow-up PRs in another session". Increment 1
  alone spans `livespec`, `livespec-driver-claude`, `livespec-driver-codex`,
  and `livespec-dev-tooling`.
- The sibling thread `plan/foreman/` in repository `livespec-overseer` is
  cross-linked, never duplicated: it owns the foreman and the consensus-panel
  implementation; this thread owns the core-owned `spec_governance` lever
  design. Neither thread closes into the other, and this binder does not mirror
  the sibling's live status. If a slice fits neither side clearly, prepare the
  classification evidence before raising that boundary as a valve.
- Write every repository name in full in maintainer-facing output. This thread
  cites `livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro` constantly, and the bare suffix
  `beads-fabro` is ambiguous with `livespec-console-beads-fabro`.

## HALT-first preconditions

Expected worker session: `spec-side-autonomy`.

Expected supervisor session: `spec-side-autonomy-supervisor`.

Exact target repository: `/data/projects/livespec`.

Run these in order before doing anything else. Stop on the first failure and
act on its labelled `REMEDY:`.

1. The supervised session exists:

```bash
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
tmux has-session -t "$WORKER_TARGET" \
  || { echo "HALT: expected worker session 'spec-side-autonomy'"; echo "REMEDY: ask the maintainer whether to start that worker session"; exit 1; }
```

2. The supervised session is a live agent session:

```bash
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
pane_pid=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" '#{pane_pid}')
[ -n "$pane_pid" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: empty pane_pid for 'spec-side-autonomy'"; echo "REMEDY: re-check the exact worker target and stop if it still resolves empty"; exit 1; }
ps -o pid=,comm=,args= --ppid "$pane_pid" --pid "$pane_pid" -H
# PASS only if a live `claude` or `codex` process appears in that tree.
# A lone shell (zsh/bash) with no agent child is a HALT.
# REMEDY: if no live agent appears, ask the maintainer whether to restart the worker.
```

Report which live driver was found. A launcher may own the `comm` column while
the agent name appears only in `args`, so read the full argument vector rather
than the command name.

3. The supervisor session exists, is a distinct pane, and contains a live agent:

```bash
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
SUPERVISOR_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy-supervisor:'
tmux has-session -t "$SUPERVISOR_TARGET" \
  || { echo "HALT: expected supervisor session 'spec-side-autonomy-supervisor'"; echo "REMEDY: switch to the correct supervisor session or ask the maintainer to bootstrap it"; exit 1; }
pane_pid=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" '#{pane_pid}')
supervisor_pane_pid=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$SUPERVISOR_TARGET" '#{pane_pid}')
[ -n "$supervisor_pane_pid" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: empty pane_pid for 'spec-side-autonomy-supervisor'"; echo "REMEDY: re-check the exact supervisor target and stop if it still resolves empty"; exit 1; }
[ "$supervisor_pane_pid" != "$pane_pid" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: supervisor and worker resolve to the SAME pane"; echo "REMEDY: re-check both exact targets — a prefix match puts both names on one pane, and the worker's agent then reads as the supervisor's"; exit 1; }
ps -o pid=,comm=,args= --ppid "$supervisor_pane_pid" --pid "$supervisor_pane_pid" -H
# PASS only if a live `claude` or `codex` process appears in that tree.
# A lone shell (zsh/bash) with no agent child is a HALT.
# REMEDY: if no live agent appears, ask the maintainer to start the agent in that session.
```

Both pids are resolved inside this block rather than inherited from the
previous check, so it is self-contained and cannot pass on an unset variable.

4. The plan thread exists inside the absolute target repository:

```bash
test -d "/data/projects/livespec/plan/spec-side-autonomy" \
  || { echo "HALT: missing plan thread /data/projects/livespec/plan/spec-side-autonomy"; echo "REMEDY: create or choose the correct plan topic before supervising"; exit 1; }
```

5. The worker pane's resolved cwd is inside the target repository:

```bash
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
pane_cwd=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" '#{pane_current_path}')
[ -n "$pane_cwd" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: empty pane_current_path for 'spec-side-autonomy'"; echo "REMEDY: re-check the exact worker target and stop if it still resolves empty"; exit 1; }
case "$(readlink -f -- "$pane_cwd")" in
  /data/projects/livespec|/data/projects/livespec/*) echo "PASS: $pane_cwd" ;;
  *) echo "HALT: pane cwd $pane_cwd is outside the target repo"; echo "REMEDY: move the worker into the target repo or start the correct worker session"; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

## How to inspect and drive

Re-measure the ledger anchor before carrying forward any filed status or
acceptance claim:

```sh
cd /data/projects/livespec
ledger_anchor='livespec-jvdvx4'
# The ledger is a per-repo tenant database, so `bd` needs the fleet credential
# wrapper WHERE ONE IS INSTALLED — a bare `bd` returns "Access denied" there.
# DETECTED, never hard-coded: an adopter without the wrapper must still be able
# to re-measure, and a hard-coded path would only trade one false HALT for
# another.
ledger_show() {
  if command -v with-livespec-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    with-livespec-env.sh -- bd show "$1" --json
  else
    bd show "$1" --json
  fi
}
if ! ledger_json="$(ledger_show "$ledger_anchor")"; then
  echo "HALT: cannot re-measure ledger item '$ledger_anchor'"
  if command -v with-livespec-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "REMEDY: the credential wrapper WAS used, so ledger access is not the suspect — check the anchor id is real and that this repo's tenant is reachable"
  else
    echo "REMEDY: no credential wrapper on PATH, so a BARE 'bd' ran — if this repo's ledger is a tenant database, install/expose the fleet credential wrapper; otherwise check the anchor id"
  fi
  exit 1
fi
# EXIT STATUS IS NOT EVIDENCE. A tool that exits 0 while printing nothing would
# let the MEASURED_AT stamp below certify a re-measurement that never happened.
[ -n "$ledger_json" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: ledger re-measure for '$ledger_anchor' exited 0 but returned NOTHING"; echo "REMEDY: do not record this as a measurement — an empty success is not a reading; confirm the anchor exists and that the ledger tool is actually reporting"; exit 1; }
printf '%s\n' "$ledger_json"
date -u '+MEASURED_AT: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'
```

The epic's children carry the per-increment status. Enumerate them from the
ledger rather than from this binder or from the thread's design record. Pass
`--all`: the default listing HIDES closed items, so a slice that was filed and
finished reads as never filed. Measured in this tenant on 2026-08-03, the same
parent returned 1 row by default and 15 rows with `--all`.

```sh
cd /data/projects/livespec
ledger_children() {
  if command -v with-livespec-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    with-livespec-env.sh -- bd list --parent "$1" --all --json
  else
    bd list --parent "$1" --all --json
  fi
}
if ! children_json="$(ledger_children 'livespec-jvdvx4')"; then
  echo "HALT: cannot enumerate children of 'livespec-jvdvx4'"
  echo "REMEDY: apply the same wrapper-versus-anchor triage as the command above before treating the epic as childless"
  exit 1
fi
printf '%s\n' "$children_json"
date -u '+MEASURED_AT: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'
```

An empty child list is a FINDING ONLY AFTER a positive control, because an
empty array is what a broken query returns too. Run the control against the
same command shape with a parent known to have children before reporting the
epic as childless:

```sh
cd /data/projects/livespec
control_parent='livespec-c1k9'   # known to have children in this tenant
if command -v with-livespec-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  control_json=$(with-livespec-env.sh -- bd list --parent "$control_parent" --all --json)
else
  control_json=$(bd list --parent "$control_parent" --all --json)
fi
case "$control_json" in
  ''|'[]') echo "HALT: the positive control returned no rows, so this query shape proves NOTHING about an empty result for the real anchor"; echo "REMEDY: fix the query or pick a control parent that certainly has children before treating any empty child list as absence"; exit 1 ;;
  *)       printf '%s\n' "PASS: control parent $control_parent returned rows, so an empty result for the real anchor is genuine absence" ;;
esac
```

Measured on 2026-08-03: the control passes, and both `livespec-jvdvx4` and the
sibling epic `livespec-hhu5pn` genuinely had zero children at that time. That
zero is trustworthy only because the control ran; re-run it, do not cite this
sentence as the measurement.

Preserve the tmux lookup verdict before filtering its output:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
pane_pid=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" '#{pane_pid}')
tmux_rc=$?
[ "$tmux_rc" -eq 0 ] \
  || { echo "HALT: tmux pane lookup failed for 'spec-side-autonomy'"; echo "REMEDY: re-check the exact target before filtering its output"; exit 1; }
printf '%s\n' "$pane_pid" | head -1
```

Inspect read-only with a scrollback sample plus the visible pane:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" -S -40
```

Check the visible footer for an open picker before every paste:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
pane=$(tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET")
tmux_rc=$?
[ "$tmux_rc" -eq 0 ] \
  || { echo "HALT: cannot inspect the worker pane before paste"; echo "REMEDY: re-check the exact worker target before sending input"; exit 1; }
if printf '%s\n' "$pane" | tail -8 \
     | grep -qE '^[[:space:]]*Enter to (select|confirm)[[:space:]]*(·.*)?$'; then
  echo "HALT: picker open in worker pane"
  echo "REMEDY: answer or close the picker before pasting new input"
  exit 1
fi
```

For a short instruction, replace the allowed runtime slot, send the text,
verify that it landed, and then send Enter separately:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_TARGET" -- '<condition-command>'
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" | tail -8   # confirm it landed
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_TARGET" Enter             # only after verifying
```

For longer text, write the reviewed instruction to `/tmp/msg.txt`, then paste,
verify, and submit it in separate calls:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
tmux load-buffer -b sup /tmp/msg.txt
tmux paste-buffer -b sup -t "$WORKER_TARGET"
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" | tail -8   # confirm it landed
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_TARGET" Enter             # only after verifying
```

Create the named wait channel, tell the worker to append one line there at every
milestone, and arm this pane watcher before ending a turn with worker-held work
in flight:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=spec-side-autonomy:'
wait_channel=/data/projects/livespec/tmp/overseer/spec-side-autonomy/worker-status.log
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$wait_channel")"
: > "$wait_channel"
# Tell the worker: append one line to "$wait_channel" at every milestone.

Use a condition watcher against the authoritative artifact for every non-pane
obligation. Test terminal state first and wake on unknown values as required by
the shared protocol. This thread's most common non-pane obligation is a spec PR
awaiting review and merge, so poll `state` before any derived field:

```sh
cd /data/projects/livespec
for i in $(seq 1 60); do
  sleep 60
  pr_state=$(gh pr view '<branch>' --json state --jq '.state')
  gh_rc=$?
  [ "$gh_rc" -eq 0 ] \
    || { echo "WAKE: cannot read PR state for '<branch>' — investigate before waiting further"; exit 0; }
  case "$pr_state" in
    MERGED|CLOSED) echo "WAKE: PR reached terminal state $pr_state"; exit 0 ;;
    OPEN)          : ;;
    *)             echo "WAKE: unrecognized PR state '$pr_state' — reporting rather than assuming it means keep waiting"; exit 0 ;;
  esac
done
echo "WAKE: PR watcher ceiling reached — still OPEN, RE-ARM NOW"
```

## Corrections

Thread-specific corrections belong here. Regeneration must preserve this
section byte-for-byte, including spelling, punctuation, code formatting, blank
lines, and ordering.

T1. A queued instruction decays. A codex worker drains its input queue only at
turn end, so orders written minutes earlier are read against a world that has
moved. In this thread the queue reached five deep and one entry — "delete
spec-governance-pr-merge.md from the branch" — was correct when written and
would have CORRUPTED v190 had it executed after the revise already rejected that
proposal into history. Interrupt, VOID the whole queue, and re-send one
instruction that opens by voiding everything prior. Never append to a stale
queue.

T2. I applied the shared protocol's own paste rule too narrowly and it bit me.
C1 says verify a paste only when its size is stable across two spaced reads; I
compared the PASTE-TOKEN size, which sat still at "1020 chars" across both reads
while the tail of the message arrived as literal text BESIDE the token. Enter
then did not submit and the composer held a mangled instruction. Compare the
WHOLE composer line, not the token's self-reported count — and better, obey C1's
second clause, which already said not to paste long briefs at all. The
file-reference path worked first try. A rule applied only when the input LOOKS
long is not a rule.
