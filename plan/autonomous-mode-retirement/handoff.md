# autonomous-mode-retirement — RECLAIMED AND LIVE

## Why this thread was reclaimed rather than a new one opened

The maintainer kicked this session at `plan/autonomous-mode-retirement/handoff.md`
— the ACTIVE path. At the time the path resolved to nothing, and the overseer's
orientation stated the thread "does not exist active or archived; you were
pointed at a handoff that was never written."

**That was false, and the overseer retracted it.** The thread existed all along.
It had been DELETED by a `git rm` on 2026-07-19 and was not yet restored when
that orientation was written; it was restored to the archive on 2026-07-20
(`46ade934` / `116a4147`). The deletion was the anomaly — not the thread — and
the maintainer's kick at the active path was deliberate.

That same `git rm` also destroyed the §"Ledger dispositions" findings added hours
earlier. That is why those dispositions no longer live only here.

## ⚠ THE BLOCKER — the retirement is NOT complete; the epic MUST NOT close

**A sibling repo's ratified spec still contracts the retired paradigm.**

`livespec-orchestrator-git-jsonl` still specifies Full autonomous mode — verified
directly against that repo's `origin/master`, not taken on restatement:

- `SPECIFICATION/contracts.md:28-32` — "**Full autonomous mode (`--autonomous`).**
  Each of the four heavyweight skills below MUST accept a dangerous, default-off
  `--autonomous` opt-in flag ... When set, the skill MUST resolve its per-item
  consent gate(s) with an LLM decision instead of prompting the user"
- `SPECIFICATION/constraints.md:94-107` — `## Autonomous mode constraints`,
  requiring the flag and "an explicit dangerous-mode acknowledgement" (the arming
  ceremony)
- `SPECIFICATION/spec.md:106` / `:112` — a live `## Autonomous mode` section;
  "**Full autonomous mode** — an opt-in, **dangerous**, **default-off** mode"

Ratified but UNIMPLEMENTED (the only `autonomous` hit under `*.py` is the shared
vendored `livespec_runtime`, not git-jsonl's own code).

Note precisely what survives: the **LLM-resolves-the-consent-gate** behavior —
the exact behavior the v034 retirement dropped as its RISKIEST part (the old
Scenario 35, the LLM guessing human decisions on `needs-human`).

**Consequence:** closing `bd-ib-24j5uy` would assert a fleet-wide retirement that
demonstrably has not happened.

**MAINTAINER DECISION — NOT delegated.** Re-steer git-jsonl's spec to the v034
policy-settings model (in which case `bd-gj-rb3` dies as-written), or consciously
keep the divergence. That is a spec-ratification call and keeps its designed
human gate. Tracked as `bd-gj-rb3` (git-jsonl tenant), flagged **do not dispatch
as-is**.

## What this thread now owns — the close-out sweep

Three independent read-only adversarial verifiers re-derived the retirement
against live state rather than trusting the ledger, the spec's claims, or
CI-green. This discharges the non-behavior-bearing acceptance form.

| Leg | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator SPEC | Clean — 8/8; retirement survived v034 → v044 without drift |
| Orchestrator IMPL | **D1 (P1)** + D2 + a test gap |
| Console | **Defect A (P1)** + Defect B |
| Cross-repo (git-jsonl) | **BLOCKER above** |

### Items this thread created

| Item | Tenant | State |
|---|---|---|
| `bd-ib-24j5uy` | orchestrator | EPIC — **OPEN**; description corrected (it falsely claimed "the IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT EXIST YET") |
| `bd-ib-24j5uy.4` | orchestrator | D1 — fix MERGED (PR #839, `952d874c`); janitor red post-merge; still `active` |
| `bd-ib-24j5uy.5` | orchestrator | D2 — review-cap parser hardcodes `_REVIEW_CAP_VISITS = 3` |
| `bd-ib-od2i` | orchestrator | The wrong-source lesson; closes when `livespec#1546` merges |
| `bd-ib-yf2m` | orchestrator | Pairing gate blocks docstring-only diffs; AST-based exemption required |
| `livespec-console-beads-fabro-bgc` | console | Defect A — Scenario-15 journal read leg dead live |
| `livespec-console-beads-fabro-co3` | console | Defect B — stale prose cluster |
| `bd-ib-0s5` | orchestrator | DETACHED from the epic; design-human-gated, stands alone |

### D1 — what landed and what did not

Fix is on master; master CI green on that SHA. Verified by re-running the
reproduction: `effective_admission_policy` now takes `cwd: Path` as a REQUIRED
keyword-only argument and the old reproduction can no longer execute
(`TypeError: missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'cwd'`) — the silent
fallback is closed at the type level across all five `effective_*` resolvers.

NOT done: the post-merge janitor went red on `check-coverage` in a fresh checkout
(kept at `~/.worktrees/livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro/janitor-bd-ib-24j5uy.4`),
so the item is stuck `active`. Master CI passing while the janitor fails on the
same SHA is itself worth diagnosing.

Owed: three stale-prose corrections (`dispatcher.py`,
`_dispatcher_cost_pricing.py`, `commands/CLAUDE.md`) staged-but-uncommitted at
`~/.worktrees/livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro/docs-retire-mode-prose`. Blocked
alone by the pairing gate; to ride along as Red-Green-Replay ride-along docs.
**Do not discard that worktree.**

## Preserved findings — the point is that this file is no longer the only copy

A `git rm` already destroyed these once. **The correct response to a file that
can be deleted is not to guard the file more carefully — it is to stop the file
being the only copy.** The §"Ledger dispositions" entries below have each been
attached as a comment on their own ledger item, in that item's own tenant. The
items always existed; what existed nowhere else was the ANALYSIS. This thread is
the narrative now, not the sole record.

### A. Ledger dispositions — 2026-07-19 fleet audit (8 tenants, 83 records, 28 open)

| Item | Tenant | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `bd-gj-rb3` | git-jsonl | **MAINTAINER DECISION — the blocker above.** Do not dispatch as-is. |
| `livespec-console-beads-fabro-nxsfih` | console | Re-scope the anchor to its residue (the missing zero-Beads guard), or file that standalone and close — its plan thread is archived while the anchor stays open. |
| `livespec-console-beads-fabro-8aw` | console | LIVE — four non-valve commands still contracted (`contracts.md:412-415`), unimplemented. Refresh its stale "v017" pointer at groom (spec is v032). |
| `livespec-console-beads-fabro-mvu22t` | console | Carries a `ready` LABEL on `backlog` STATUS — one of the two is wrong. |
| `livespec-runtime-f5zhs5` | runtime | Same label/status contradiction. |
| `bd-ib-98c.5` / `.12` / `.7` | orchestrator | Recorded `backlog` while their proofs demonstrably ran and landed. Reconcile: stale-open, or proofs ran ahead of a formal close. NOT a reason to move anything out of the acceptance lane. |

Already executed — **do not re-do**: `-3rdmqu` closed, `livespec-1t17` closed,
`livespec-0jxs` regroomed. **Do not re-close** the already-closed phantom-open
set (console `-yvikqp` + W1–W7, `-rt4`, `-pke3y3`, `-mb64bv`, `-d6o`, the `-0ak`
freeform children, orchestrator `bd-ib-82a`, O0–O10, Stage-2 throwaways). Adopter
tenants (`openbrain`, `resume`, `homelab`) were UNREACHABLE — not proof they are
clean. No dangling dependency edges and no wrong-tenant filings were found.

### B. Disposition sweep — findings that would otherwise die (NONE YET FILED)

Carried forward verbatim in substance from the original thread. Each is
**VERIFY-THEN-FILE**: check the owning tenant first, since filing a duplicate is
its own cruft — and per this thread's own lesson, that check must include CLOSED
records, which the default listing hides.

| Finding | Likely home |
|---|---|
| **Review-gate integrity hole** — a reviewer verdict lost to silence reads as a PASS; absence of an explicit verdict artifact must be a hard FAIL. Raised cont.15, reinforced cont.16, explicitly never filed ("maintainer's call"). **Highest value in this table.** | orchestrator |
| Spec-proposal defect taxonomy — claims that expire at ratification; prefer positive assertions about sibling-owned surfaces; clause-lockstep-at-revise as a Fable criterion | standing Fable-review criteria (`.ai/` topic or CLAUDE.md) |
| `list_work_items.py` drops `merge_sha` / `pr_number` from `--json` | orchestrator |
| Live-ledger hygiene backfill (62 console violations); console has no merge-evidence check | console |
| cont.20 flags 1–5: auto-merge vs review-gated manual PRs; impl→spec gate gap (`detect-impl-gaps` not gating); move source-breadth; `move:active` bypasses `wip_cap`; config-manifest self-version | orchestrator / console |
| Heading-coverage tier keyword sets diverge (console Rust check vs dev-tooling Python check overlap only on `integration`) | dev-tooling or console |
| Console coverage-convention lesson — the 100%-line-coverage gate is incompatible with MULTI-LINE `assert!` carrying interpolated messages; use single-line bare asserts | console guidance |
| Orchestrator operational lessons — sequentially-coupled items need `depends_on`; research-item close-in-place pattern; `mint_app_token.py` mints a REAL token (security) | orchestrator guidance |

## The lesson this thread kept re-teaching

**A green-looking signal read off the wrong source is not evidence.** Recorded as
`.ai/verifying-against-the-right-source.md` (PR `livespec#1546`), with instances
spanning three repos and two independent operators. Encountered here:

1. A passing suite that never exercised the live call site hid D1.
2. A fixture encoding the RETIRED wire shape hid Defect A.
3. A default `gh pr list` (open-only) hid an already-merged PR → duplicate PR for
   finished work.
4. A stale local `remotes/origin/*` ref read as proof of a push that never
   happened.
5. A default ledger listing hiding CLOSED records defeated a dedup sweep.
6. A dispatch reported `exit 0` while its `status` was `failed` — the shell exit
   came from a trailing `tail`, not the dispatcher.
7. From this thread's own audit correction: an artifact search that missed
   `plan/archive/` concluded a dispatch never ran. **An archived thread moves
   every path it owns.**

## Corrections the overseer made to its own directives

Recorded because they are load-bearing, and because a thread that logs only the
operator's corrections and not the supervisor's is not an honest record.

1. **"The thread does not exist, active or archived."** False — it existed and
   had been deleted. See the reclaim rationale above.
2. **"The retirement is essentially done."** Retracted on discovering
   `bd-gj-rb3`: a sibling's ratified spec still contracts the retired paradigm,
   so the retirement is not fleet-wide complete.

## NEXT ACTION

**Surface `bd-gj-rb3` to the maintainer as the one genuine blocker.** It is a
spec-ratification call and is not ours to make.

Then, in any order: diagnose D1's post-merge janitor failure and drive
`bd-ib-24j5uy.4` to `done`; land the ride-along prose; work D2, Defect A,
Defect B; and file the §B findings after verifying against each tenant.

**Do not close `bd-ib-24j5uy`** until the cross-repo gap is dispositioned.

## Deliberately NOT owned here

- **`bd-ib-0s5`** — detached deliberately. A design-human-gated spec amendment on
  cost-gate coverage, not retirement work. Closing it with the epic would bury a
  real open question about a fail-open cost gate; holding the epic open for it
  would misrepresent a finished retirement.
- **The console cockpit programme** — `livespec-console-beads-fabro:plan/cockpit-ux-docs-release/`.
  Reference it; never copy its state. Duplicating a sibling's programme is what
  broke the original `plan/autonomous-mode/` thread.

## Provenance

The original charter and its execution record are preserved in git history at
`46ade934` (`plan/archive/autonomous-mode-retirement/handoff.md`, 253 lines). Its
`NEXT ACTION` and status claims are stale by design and must not be read as live
instructions. The design record three sibling specs cite remains
`plan/archive/autonomous-mode/handoff.md`, section
`SESSION UPDATE — 2026-07-14 (cont. 12)` — do not move it without amending
`livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro` `contracts.md:1594` / `:1649` and
`livespec-console-beads-fabro` `spec.md:340` in the same landing.
